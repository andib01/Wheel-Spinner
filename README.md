# Wheel-Spinner-

Wheel spinning luck based game made with Flutter and Dart.

Project explained: With this project i wish to create a game wherein users will be allowed to select a number of their choosing, the said number will then be stored inside a wheel and take certain space in it depending on how many players have joined. For instance, if there are two players, each players number will take exactly half of the wheel, with 3 players 1/3 of it and so on. After all the players have choosen their numbers the wheel will begin to spin with an animation showing only the numbers picked by players rather than placeholder numbers. After a spin finishes a random number will be chosen as the winner. The winner will then be prompted by a message asking whether they are present, if there is no reply within a minute of the message there will be a message indicating that the said user is not present, the user will be removed fro inactivity and the wheel will spin again until eventually finding another winner. In the case of two players being left and one of them being AFK the game will be cancelled. If a winner does respond that they are present, they will be given an award either in the form of points or virtual money.
